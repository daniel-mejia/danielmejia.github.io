                                Launched September 2015, <a href="https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/" target="_blank">The Graide Network (TGN)</a> connects teachers with undergraduate education majors. These undergraduates help teachers grade their students’ work. Currently, the grading takes place off-platform, via downloadable Excel templates. Our task was to prepare low- to mid-fidelity interaction designs focused on the teacher's side of the platform. We conducted user interviews and usability testing, as well as broader field research, in order to find and improve pain points in the current process, know how our client compares with competitions, and determine their value in the education technology ecosystem.

                                In our first round of testing, we interviewed seven teachers who had never used the platform. We wanted to know their daily struggles as educators and determine how TGN can be useful to them. I studied the educational technology ecosystem and made a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. This analysis aimed to define what sets our client apart from competitors. The official name for undergrad students who help teachers grade assignments in this platform is "Graiders". But for clarity, I will use the term "graders" instead.

                            First, we interviewed teachers to learn about their grading process without assistants or tools. Then we had teachers use The Graide Network while sharing their thoughts aloud. They also used our client's competitor to draw comparison between both products. From this test, we got educators’ insight about how we can improve their grading process. We listed pain points and preferences they had with the interface.

                               We created our designs around <strong>three essential tasks: adding a new class, posting an assignment, and analyzing the grade report.</strong> The team adopted a multivariate testing approach. We had seven teachers use and compare how each or our prototypes managed the three essential tasks. By thinking aloud, they informed us about their preferences. Three of the seven teachers interviewed have used The Graide Network before. Our focus was on how teachers interacted with the platform, so actual grading was not tested

                                    We recommended automating the process of uploading rubrics to assignments. Teachers can save time by creating and saving rubrics to reuse in the platform, eliminating the need to use external tools like Google or Rubistar. It also reduces human error when graders don't populate the rubric manually. Searching databases to find and load rubrics, such as a standard STEM rubric is also useful.

                                    Currently, finding a grader is a confusing double opt-in process. It wasn't clear to teachers that they needed to wait for a grader to accept their request to grade an assignment. They confused sending a request to grade with assigning to grade homework. This issue highlights the importance of improving communication between teachers and graders.  
                                </p>

                                    We recommended showing a list of favorite or suggested graders along with their availability. This addition could make the process more social and also add a personal touch, facilitating an honest and longstanding relationship.

                                    A rating system can boost a grader's credibility, improving their skills with teacher's feedback and mentorship. Furthermore, teachers will make informed selection by reading colleague's recommendations and reviews.

                                    In our research, I identified and tested an opportunity for the The Graide Network to add value to their product. By helping teachers identify and create custom groups of struggling students to track their progress, teachers can provide targeted lessons, give relevant feedback and measure the effectiveness of their strategy. Grouping students with similar needs and creating custom lessons for them, is a common strategy between teachers. But, currently educators don't have a tool that helps them track progress on particular groups of students.

                                    This tool can prove particularly valuable for teachers who get pay raises based on student performance. And again, because "grouping" is a standard practice between teachers, it makes the platform relatable and easier to sell.

                                    Scalability was one of the challenges we faced while redesigning this product. The Graide Network can change the education system by becoming a progress measuring tool for teachers and students. Although that's a good selling point, it is not the platform's minimal viable product. Being a means for teachers to find undergraduate students that can help them grade student's homework and provide actionable feedback is The Graide Network’s primary function. That's what makes the platform unique. Focusing on improving that relationship will add value to the product. In our process, we had to stay mindful and not lose track by adding too many secondary features. Nevertheless, we found that sharing with our client any opportunity for growth was essential.

                                    Being part of something that can change the education system so positively was incredibly rewarding. The Graide Network will benefit a lot of people with its success. Teachers have a tool that gives them more control over students’ progress and achievements. It improves students’ education and their chance of becoming successful, productive citizens, at the same time, bettering educators' own productivity and work-life balance. It also helps parents keep a closer look at their kid's education. And finally, The Graide Network benefits society as a whole by developing generations of more educated people.
