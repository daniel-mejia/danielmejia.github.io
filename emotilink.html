                        Emotilink is an innovative healthcare technology startup based in the MATTER healthcare incubator. Its mission is to revolutionize mental health support by providing a pioneering mobile app and platform. Emotilink is committed to breaking down barriers to emotional support by offering real-time, HIPAA-compliant telemedicine encounters with mental health therapists. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        The Emotilink team contacted my UX team and me for a consultation. Our task was identifying potential user concerns and opportunities and creating an initial design for their mobile and desktop applications. We conducted extensive user and domain research to inform our design process. Upon completing the project, we delivered low—to mid-fidelity interaction designs that provided a secure, focused, and seamless user experience for therapists and patients.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        My role in the project was as a UX designer. My responsibilities included planning and conducting user interviews and surveys with my colleagues. We took turns moderating user interviews and taking notes. Afterward, we analyzed and synthesized the research results as a team and brainstormed design solutions. I took ownership of the competitive analysis because finding existing design patterns and opportunities to give my client an edge over their competitors was essential.

                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        My main challenge as a designer was to help people feel safe and secure enough to be open to using this technology to improve their mental health. I understood the task was sensitive and required considerable empathy and tact during conversations with participants.

                                A lot of individuals go through emotional distress and need support but often struggle to access mental health services due to various barriers. These barriers can include not knowing about available resources, having trouble finding an in-person therapist, and feeling uncomfortable when choosing a therapist.

                       <strong>Are people open to virtual therapy?</strong>
                        Yes, they are. Out of 38 respondents, 37 have used or considered using mental health services. From this group, ten were interested in using an app to connect with a mental health counselor, versus three who said no and the majority (20) who “would need to see the application in action to decide,” placing the burden for adoption on the user experience.

                       <strong>Who will use the app?</strong>
                        People who need immediate improvement in their emotional well-being. These individuals have faced challenges and struggled to find someone to talk to due to scheduling conflicts or a lack of available providers. They seek a tool to help them connect with a trustworthy, accessible, and relatable professional who shares a common identity and life experiences. They need someone to help them navigate short-term issues when they arise.

                                Knowing insurance options is complex and needs to be more transparent. 48.5% are unaware of their insurance plan’s mental health services reimbursement rates, and 39.4% believe they know them. Participants are willing to pay $10 to $120 out-of-pocket for a one-hour session if their insurance doesn’t cover it.

                                Therapists want to determine if they are an appropriate fit for the patient. If not, they explain the situation to their patients and recommend another professional who could be a better fit.

                                Opening up to someone is a slow process. Therapists must communicate clearly and set expectations to establish trust and rapport quickly. They help users get in the right mindset. They expect the platform to be transparent with users’ expectations and aid with building long-term relationships.

                                It can be awkward to bring up payment during sessions, but billing medical insurance for virtual services and ensuring competitive rates are important aspects to consider.

                    We meticulously studied five of Emotilink’s competitors (Amwell, Breakthrough, Doctor on Demand, Talkspace, and Teladoc) at the time (2016) and analyzed their features and offerings. This comprehensive analysis gave us a clear understanding of the market landscape and helped us identify areas where Emotilink could differentiate itself.

                            After gathering and analyzing our research findings, we began the design process. We brainstormed solutions to each problem expressed by our users and did rough wireframing on features that address critical user needs. This process allowed us to iteratively refine our design based on user feedback and our understanding of the problem space.

                            The project outcomes were discussed, including metrics and user feedback. The Emotilink team was satisfied with the result. The solutions we provided were aligned with the data gathered from users themselves. We recommended further user testing to ensure that the design satisfies user needs. We informed them that evaluation research will uncover potential issues with our designs before the technology makes it into production. Additionally, we plan to talk with engineers to review the feasibility of our recommendations so that the business can adjust to budget considerations by prioritizing and downscaling as needed.

                            Everyone benefits from talking with a therapist, including the therapist. Technology has been pivotal in improving humanity’s livelihood and longevity, but strides are still being made to help people’s emotional well-being. It was great to be part of this landmark effort and to use my design skills to play a small part in making mental and emotional health accessible to more people using current technology.
