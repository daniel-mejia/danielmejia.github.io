                                    Emotilink, a groundbreaking healthcare technology startup in the MATTER healthcare incubator, aims to transform mental health support. Their pioneering mobile app and platform are designed to eliminate barriers to emotional support by providing real-time, HIPAA-compliant telemedicine encounters with mental health therapists. This innovative approach, which includes unique features such as [specific unique features], is poised to usher in a new era of mental health support.

                                    The Emotilink team contacted my UX team and me for a consultation. Our task was identifying potential user concerns and opportunities and creating an initial design for their mobile and desktop applications. We conducted extensive user and domain research to inform our design process. Upon completing the project, we delivered low—to mid-fidelity interaction designs that provided a secure, focused, and seamless user experience for therapists and patients.

                                    My role in the project was as a UX designer. My responsibilities included planning and conducting user interviews and surveys with my colleagues. We took turns moderating user interviews and taking notes. Afterward, we analyzed and synthesized the research results as a team and brainstormed design solutions. I took ownership of the competitive analysis because finding existing design patterns and opportunities to give my client an edge over their competitors was essential.

                                    My main challenge as a designer was to create an experience where people feel safe and secure enough to open up to a therapist in a virtual setting. This required a high level of empathy and tact during conversations with participants. I needed to find a way to make a technology that could be used and seen as a tool for everyone to improve their mental health. I understood the task was sensitive and required considerable empathy and tact during conversations with participants.

                                               <strong>Are people open to virtual therapy?</strong><br>
                                               Yes, they are. Out of 38 respondents, 37 have used or considered using mental health services. From this group, ten were interested in using an app to connect with a mental health counselor, versus three who said no and the majority (20) who “would need to see the application in action to decide,” placing the burden for adoption on the user experience.

                                                People who need immediate improvement in their emotional well-being. These individuals have faced challenges and struggled to find someone to talk to due to scheduling conflicts or a lack of available providers. They need someone to help them navigate short-term issues when they arise.

Participants are willing to pay $10 to $120 out-of-pocket for a one-hour session if their insurance doesn’t cover it.

                                            Therapists want to determine if they are an appropriate fit for the patient. If not, they explain the situation to their patients and recommend another professional who could be a better fit.

                                            Opening up to someone is a slow process. Therapists must communicate clearly and set expectations to establish trust and rapport quickly. They help users get in the right mindset. They expect the platform to be transparent with users’ expectations and aid with building long-term relationships.

                                    The project outcomes were discussed, including metrics and user feedback. The Emotilink team was satisfied with the result. The solutions we provided were aligned with the data gathered from users themselves. We recommended further user testing to ensure that the design satisfies user needs. We informed them that evaluation research will uncover potential issues with our designs before the technology makes it into production. Additionally, we plan to talk with engineers to review the feasibility of our recommendations so that the business can adjust to budget considerations by prioritizing and downscaling as needed.

                                    Everyone benefits from talking with a therapist, including the therapist. Technology has been pivotal in improving humanity’s livelihood and longevity, but strides are still being made to help people’s emotional well-being. It was great to be part of this landmark effort and to use my design skills to play a small part in making mental and emotional health accessible to more people using current technology.
