                        Emotilink, a groundbreaking healthcare technology startup in the MATTER healthcare incubator, aims to transform mental health support. Their pioneering mobile app and platform are designed to eliminate barriers to emotional support by providing real-time, HIPAA-compliant telemedicine encounters with mental health therapists. This innovative approach, which includes unique features such as [specific unique features], is poised to usher in a new era of mental health support.

                    <p class="lead">
                        The Emotilink team contacted my UX team and me for a consultation. Our task was identifying potential user concerns and opportunities and creating an initial design for their mobile and desktop applications. We conducted extensive user and domain research to inform our design process. Upon completing the project, we delivered low—to mid-fidelity interaction designs that provided a secure, focused, and seamless user experience for therapists and patients.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        My role in the project was as a UX designer. My responsibilities included planning and conducting user interviews and surveys with my colleagues. We took turns moderating user interviews and taking notes. Afterward, we analyzed and synthesized the research results as a team and brainstormed design solutions. I took ownership of the competitive analysis because finding existing design patterns and opportunities to give my client an edge over their competitors was essential.

                    <p class="lead">
                        My main challenge as a designer was to create an experience where people feel safe and secure enough to open up to a therapist in a virtual setting. This required a high level of empathy and tact during conversations with participants. I needed to find a way to make a technology that could be used and seen as a tool for everyone to improve their mental health. I understood the task was sensitive and required considerable empathy and tact during conversations with participants.

                        A lot of individuals go through emotional distress and need support but often struggle to access mental health services due to various barriers. These barriers can include not knowing about available resources, having trouble finding an in-person therapist, and feeling uncomfortable when choosing a therapist.

                                    Knowing insurance options is complex and needs to be more transparent. 48.5% are unaware of their insurance plan’s mental health services reimbursement rates, and 39.4% believe they know them. Participants are willing to pay $10 to $120 out-of-pocket for a one-hour session if their insurance doesn’t cover it.

                                Opening up to someone is a slow process. Therapists must communicate clearly and set expectations to establish trust and rapport quickly. They help users get in the right mindset. They expect the platform to be transparent with users’ expectations and aid with building long-term relationships.

                                It’s challenging to determine a patient’s mindset and safety without reading body language and managing failed connections and dropped calls so patients do not feel ignored.

                    We meticulously studied five of Emotilink’s competitors (Amwell, Breakthrough, Doctor on Demand, Talkspace, and Teladoc) at the time (2016) and analyzed their features and offerings. This comprehensive analysis involved examining user interfaces, reading user reviews, and understanding their business models. It gave us a clear understanding of the market landscape and helped us identify areas where Emotilink could differentiate itself.

We then conducted two rounds of user testing and iteratively refined our design based on users’ feedback.

                        We designed a desktop application for Therapists, giving them enough space to manage their patients' information comfortably and efficiently.

The solutions we provided were aligned with the data gathered from users themselves. We recommended further user testing to ensure that the design satisfies user needs. We informed them that evaluation research will uncover potential issues with our designs before the technology makes it into production. Additionally, we plan to talk with engineers to review the feasibility of our recommendations so that the business can adjust to budget considerations by prioritizing and downscaling as needed.
