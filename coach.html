However, despite the availability of personal metrics, people continue to struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

                                My team and I brainstormed a strategy to find out why people weren’t reaching their fitness goals. We made interviews and a survey to gather enough data for our research. We wanted to know how people defined healthy living, their efforts to achieve that lifestyle, their goals, and frustrations. Our main takeaway was that <strong>most people want to live a healthy lifestyle but don’t feel motivated enough to make it a priority.</strong>

                                    I kept in mind where our users preferred working out when tackling the issue of accessibility.  Since the majority of our subjects said they got their fitness information from people more advanced than them. We concluded that other than accountability, <strong>learning from a trustworthy source was a key element for our users.</strong> We deduced that for our app to motivate the user, it had to cater to their personal needs and be an authoritative source of information.

On weekdays, he stays late at the office and, on weekends, he hangs out with his buddies. Every week he promises himself to start exercising on Monday. But he never follows through because he has a hangover. <strong>Pete really doesn't want to go to the gym. He prefers lingering at the office working or with his friends drinking beer and eating buffalo wings.</strong> He’s insecure about his body and gets self-conscious around fitter types in the gym.

He wakes up at 4am to go to the gym but feels stuck doing the same routines without achieving greater results. He wants to eat better but doesn’t know how. Keeping an eye on his long-term goals is also important. He once wanted to compete but now feels discouraged and bored.

                                        We did research on competitors and learned that few fitness app gave users personalized exercise options and most only worked as trackers. One of the few that offered personal options was <a href="http://fitstar.com/">Fitstart</a>, but it had the shortcoming of not overseeing the user’s form. This oversight would have led Pete or Matt to injure themselves. Another app that was not just a tracker was <a href="http://www.thefabulous.co/">The Fabulous</a>, which worked as a motivator to help the user build healthy habits. Its problem was that it only focused on broader solutions, it didn't offer targeted, individualized options. <strong>Giving Pete and Matt's options based on their goals without losing sight of the root causes adds value to our app and gives us an edge in the market.</strong>

                                    We felt that Pete is struggling more than Matt establishing a healthy life. <strong>Helping Pete became our primary concern and main focus since making a product for him benefits Matt as well.</strong>  Each of us came up with a few concepts, discussed them and then singled one out for testing. With a series of interviews, we pointed out which concept pushed Pete into action and why. (chosen concepts are bold)

                                        My app relied too much on the onboarding process and didn't have a clear language. It initially led people to think that Pete had to join a group to work out. David’s and Misaki’s app did make Pete join a group. <strong>My app encouraged Pete to enroll in exciting activities</strong> he can do on his own like diving, biking, and other gym alternatives. Optionally he’ll meet health-oriented people and become more health-oriented by association.

                                    The trends that surface were: interviewers felt that booking a coach pushes Pete into action; they want to work out doing something other than going to the gym. They’d rather workout by themselves and not as part of a group.

                                    Now the team faces a problem. Our best scoring app is not appealing enough for Pete to download. Pete avoids the gym because he dislikes feeling awkward. Why will he download an app that makes him go to the gym? <strong>Users repeatedly said they don’t like going to the gym so they wouldn’t use the app (Pete), but they’d recommend it to a friend who goes to the gym (Matt). They did, on the other hand, express interest in fun alternatives to the gym (Pete more than Matt).</strong>  I argued that we have to stay committed to Pete and not ignore the user’s feedback. The team finally decided to bring together the user’s wants into one product.

                                    We merged concepts and named it COACH, an app to book personal trainers and other types of fitness professionals. These specialized coaches show Pete the ropes in any activity he wants to learn. He can lift weights, try a class or sport until he got comfortable enough to do it on his own. Expert coaches help Pete feel comfortable on a<strong> one on one session.</strong> And because Matt already knew how to train, he can now book a professional anywhere he wants.

                                    No gym will let a trainer walk in to meet with a non-gym member, train them and then leave. Gyms make money out of memberships, personal training, and classes. The financial, safety and legal details of how the app worked were not taken well into account. When our instructor pointed this out, I knew we needed to look back at our research. Our best option was to look for another, realistic way to solve Pete’s problem.

If Pete works out consistently and doesn’t see any results, for example, he can address his concern with the coach. Control of expectations empowers Pete to take responsibility for his training.

                                    The new version of COACH solves the issues just pointed out that surfaced in our initial research. It also tackles the product’s feasibility and viability issues pointed out in the final stages of conceptualization. But is also makes the product easier to market by adding value to those independent trainers. They have the option to use the app as their main or partial source of income. The convenience of booking many clients virtually gives them the freedom to train as many clients as they can handle on their own schedule. These are all assumptions that need to be researched further to be confirmed or denied. We would start by establishing if the rating system and graphs are an effective source of accountability for trainers.

                                    <strong>Focusing on the user is not enough.</strong> It is also my responsibility to deliver a product that is not only ideal but feasible. One cannot live without the other. This fact pivoted our attitude and made us come up with a better product. It might be okay to have an unpractical mindset while idealizing the concept. But testing must be used to match the technology with how the user thinks the app should work. Doing a robust domain research and asking better questions is key to matching the user’s mindset and weed out impractical possibilities. Users are smart and point out things that don’t make sense. Questions like: “Do I have to be a member of that gym to train with this coach?” should’ve been enough to point us in the right direction. Making us do further research to adjust the concept over and over again.
